# Simple-Q&A-model
Build a simple question-answering application based on a `Large Language Model (LLM)`. The application uses `LangChain` and the `Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)` technique to retrieve relevant information from documents and generate answers. It also deploys an API using `LangServe` and `FastAPI`.
